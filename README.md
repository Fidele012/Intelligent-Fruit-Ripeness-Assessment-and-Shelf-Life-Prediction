# Intelligent-Fruit-Ripeness-Assessment-and-Shelf-Life-Prediction

Fruit Shelf Life Prediction Model: Complete Implementation Plan
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
This document outlines a comprehensive implementation strategy for comparing traditional machine learning approaches with deep learning approaches to predict fruit shelf life from images. The plan addresses all assignment requirements while maintaining scientific rigor, transparency, and reproducibility.

PART 1: PROBLEM DEFINITION & ALIGNMENT
Problem Statement
The core problem is: Can we accurately predict the number of days a specific fruit will remain edible (shelf life) based on a photograph of the fruit at the point of purchase?
This problem is meaningful and addresses a critical real-world challenge in African agricultural supply chains. Post-harvest losses represent a significant economic burden on smallholder farmers and informal retailers across Sub-Saharan Africa. By automating shelf life prediction, sellers and farmers can make data-driven decisions about pricing strategies, storage optimization, and inventory management, directly reducing food waste and increasing profitability.
The problem aligns with sustainable development goals (SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production) and addresses practical barriers in African commerce where formal cold chain infrastructure is limited and sellers lack access to expert agricultural knowledge.
Connection to Machine Learning
This is a supervised learning problem that can be framed in two ways:

Classification Approach: Predict the ripeness stage (unripe, ripe, rotten, overripe) as discrete categories
Regression Approach: Predict the exact number of days until spoilage as a continuous value

Both approaches are valid and will be explored to demonstrate comparative insights. Classification is more interpretable (clear categories help sellers make quick decisions), while regression is more precise for inventory management systems.

PART 2: DATASET SELECTION & JUSTIFICATION
Dataset Choice
The dataset selected is the "Fruit Arrival Time and Shelf Life Dataset" sourced from Kaggle, which is an external, open-source dataset explicitly not from sklearn or keras libraries. This dataset is directly relevant to the problem because it contains:

Original fruit images captured in real market and storage conditions
Temporal metadata (arrival dates, spoilage dates, shelf life in days)
Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity during storage)
Fruit type and ripeness stage annotations
Approximately 1,000 curated images across multiple fruit types

Dataset Characteristics
The dataset encompasses approximately 1,000 images distributed across fruit types common in African markets (bananas, mangoes, apples, oranges, and other tropical fruits). Each image has associated metadata including the ripeness stage at capture, environmental storage conditions, and the actual shelf life observed (days until spoilage was detected).
Justification for Dataset Choice
This dataset is rich and directly relevant because it bridges the gap between visual appearance and temporal degradation—the core relationship we wish to model. Unlike generic image classification datasets, this dataset includes time-series measurements of shelf life, making it uniquely suited for regression-based shelf life prediction. The real-world context (market storage conditions, mixed fruit types) adds ecological validity to the project.

PART 4: DATA PREPROCESSING & FEATURE ENGINEERING STRATEGY
Phase 4.1: Initial Data Exploration
Before any modeling, the implementation will begin with comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA):
Data Loading: The dataset will be loaded into a pandas DataFrame to examine structure, data types, missing values, and distributions.
Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics will be computed for all numerical features (shelf life duration, temperature, humidity measurements, image metadata).
Missing Value Analysis: All columns will be checked for missing, null, or anomalous values. The strategy for handling missing values will be explicitly documented (e.g., forward fill for time series, mean imputation for features, or exclusion of incomplete records).
Outlier Detection: Statistical methods (IQR, z-scores) will identify outliers in shelf life measurements and environmental variables. The decision to retain, remove, or transform outliers will be justified.
Class/Target Distribution: Histograms and counts will visualize the distribution of shelf life values or ripeness classes to identify potential class imbalance.
Data Visualization: Scatter plots, histograms, and box plots will reveal patterns, correlations, and potential issues before modeling begins.
Phase 4.2: Image Preprocessing
All 1,000 fruit images will undergo systematic preprocessing:
Image Loading and Validation: Each image file will be loaded and validated to ensure correct format, dimensions, and integrity. Corrupted or incomplete images will be removed.
Resizing and Normalization: All images will be resized to a standard dimension (e.g., 224×224 pixels, which is standard for transfer learning models). Pixel values will be normalized from the raw [0, 255] range to [0, 1] by dividing by 255.
Handling Different Image Orientations: Some images may be rotated or captured at different angles. A consistent orientation protocol will be applied (or rotations will be noted as augmentation opportunities).
Phase 4.3: Feature Extraction (Critical Step)
The implementation will extract features through two distinct approaches, to be used in different model pipelines:
Approach A: Manual Feature Extraction (For Traditional ML)
Color Features: RGB color histograms will be computed for each image, capturing the distribution of red, green, and blue channels. This results in 256 values per channel (768 total color features).
Texture Features: Using established computer vision methods (GLCM—Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix), texture properties such as contrast, homogeneity, energy, and correlation will be extracted. These four features characterize the fine-grained texture patterns that change as fruit ripens or deteriorates.
Shape Features: Image contours will be detected and analyzed to extract shape descriptors including area, perimeter, circularity, aspect ratio, and solidity. These features help distinguish between different fruit types and sizes.
Defect Features: Brown spots, blemishes, and rotten areas typically appear as dark or discolored regions. Image segmentation will be applied to identify and quantify these defective areas as a percentage of total fruit surface.
Combined Feature Vector: All manual features will be concatenated into a single feature vector per image (approximately 800-1000 features).
Approach B: Pre-trained Deep Learning Features (For Comparison)
Rather than manually designing features, a pre-trained deep neural network (ResNet50, trained on ImageNet with 1.4 million images) will be used as a feature extractor. This network has learned generalizable visual representations across diverse real-world images.
Process: Each fruit image will be passed through ResNet50 up to the final classification layer (excluding the top classification layer). The output of the second-to-last layer (the global average pooling layer) will be extracted, producing a 2,048-dimensional feature vector per image.
Rationale: Pre-trained features leverage transfer learning—knowledge learned from a massive, diverse image dataset. For small datasets (1,000 images), these pre-trained features often outperform manually designed features because they capture complex, hierarchical visual patterns.
Phase 4.4: Dataset Preparation and Splitting
After feature extraction, the complete dataset will be prepared for modeling:
Feature Matrix Construction: All extracted features (either manual or pre-trained) will be organized into a feature matrix X with dimensions (n_samples, n_features). For manual features: (1000, ~800). For pre-trained features: (1000, 2048).
Target Variable Preparation: The target variable y will be prepared based on the chosen problem formulation:

Classification: Convert shelf life values into discrete ripeness classes (e.g., 0=unripe, 1=ripe, 2=overripe, 3=rotten)
Regression: Keep shelf life as continuous values (days)

Feature Scaling: All numerical features will be standardized using z-score normalization: (x - mean) / standard_deviation. This transformation ensures all features have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, which is critical for distance-based models (SVM) and improves convergence for gradient-based methods.
Train-Validation-Test Split: The dataset will be split into three portions:

Training set: 70% (700 samples) — used to train models
Validation set: 15% (150 samples) — used to tune hyperparameters and monitor overfitting during training
Test set: 15% (150 samples) — held out until final evaluation to provide an unbiased estimate of generalization performance

Stratified splitting will ensure that the distribution of classes (or target values across ranges) is preserved in each split. This is especially important if classes are imbalanced.
Handling Class Imbalance (if applicable): If the classification problem exhibits severe class imbalance (e.g., 60% ripe, 30% rotten, 10% unripe), remedial measures will be applied to the training set only:

Class weight balancing: Assign higher loss weights to minority classes during training
Synthetic oversampling (SMOTE): Generate synthetic samples of minority classes
Stratified cross-validation: Ensure each fold maintains class distribution


PART 5: TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE
Phase 5.1: Baseline Model Establishment
A simple baseline model will be established first to set a performance anchor:
Logistic Regression as Baseline: For classification tasks, logistic regression will serve as the baseline. This linear model is fast to train, highly interpretable, and provides a minimal performance threshold against which more complex models are compared. If this simple model performs surprisingly well, it suggests the problem may be linearly separable. If it performs poorly, it justifies the use of more complex models.
Linear Regression as Baseline: For regression tasks (predicting exact shelf life in days), simple linear regression will be the baseline, assuming a linear relationship between features and shelf life.
Results Recording: Baseline performance metrics (accuracy for classification, RMSE for regression) will be recorded in an experiment table for later comparison.
Phase 5.2: Traditional ML Model Implementations
Four traditional machine learning models will be implemented and trained sequentially. Each model will be explored with multiple hyperparameter configurations.
Model 1: Random Forest
Conceptual Overview: Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features. Predictions from all trees are aggregated (majority vote for classification, average for regression) to produce the final prediction.
Why This Model: Random Forests are robust, handle non-linear relationships well, require minimal preprocessing, and provide feature importance scores for interpretability.
Training Process:

Initialize a Random Forest with initial hyperparameters (e.g., n_estimators=100, max_depth=10)
Fit the model on the training set (700 samples)
Generate predictions on the validation set (150 samples)
Compute validation metrics (accuracy/RMSE)
If performance is unsatisfactory, adjust hyperparameters and repeat

Hyperparameter Variations (Experiments 1-3):

Experiment 1: n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, min_samples_split=2 (default-like)
Experiment 2: n_estimators=200, max_depth=15, min_samples_split=5 (more complex)
Experiment 3: n_estimators=300, max_depth=20, min_samples_split=3 (even more complex)

Rationale for Variations: Increasing n_estimators (more trees) typically improves performance up to a point. Increasing max_depth and decreasing min_samples_split allows the model to capture more complex patterns but risks overfitting. These experiments test this trade-off.
Model 2: Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
Conceptual Overview: XGBoost is an advanced ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, with each new tree correcting errors made by previous trees. It uses a gradient-boosting framework to optimize a specified loss function.
Why This Model: XGBoost is known for high predictive accuracy, especially on tabular data. It automatically handles feature interactions and can be very efficient.
Training Process:

Initialize XGBoost with initial hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=100)
Fit on training set with early stopping: if validation loss doesn't improve for 10 consecutive rounds, stop training
Generate predictions on validation set
Compute validation metrics
Adjust hyperparameters and iterate

Hyperparameter Variations (Experiments 4-6):

Experiment 4: max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=100 (conservative)
Experiment 5: max_depth=7, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=200 (moderate)
Experiment 6: max_depth=10, learning_rate=0.01, n_estimators=500 (aggressive learning with fine-grained updates)

Rationale: Lower learning rates require more estimators but can find better optima. Deeper trees capture more complexity. These experiments explore this space.
Model 3: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Conceptual Overview: SVM finds a hyperplane that maximally separates classes (or fits regression targets) while minimizing prediction errors. It uses kernel functions to handle non-linear relationships.
Why This Model: SVM is theoretically grounded, works well in high-dimensional spaces (important since we have ~800-2048 features), and has proven effective for image classification tasks.
Training Process:

Initialize SVM with initial hyperparameters (e.g., kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='scale')
Fit on training set
Generate predictions on validation set
Compute validation metrics
Adjust hyperparameters and iterate

Hyperparameter Variations (Experiments 7-9):

Experiment 7: kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='scale' (standard)
Experiment 8: kernel='rbf', C=10.0, gamma='scale' (stricter classification)
Experiment 9: kernel='rbf', C=0.1, gamma='scale' (more lenient, smoother decision boundary)

Rationale: The C parameter controls the penalty for misclassification. Higher C forces tighter fitting to the training data (risk of overfitting), while lower C allows more margin (generalization). These experiments test this trade-off.
Model 4: Logistic Regression (Enhanced)
Conceptual Overview: A linear probabilistic classifier that models the probability of class membership using a sigmoid function.
Why This Model: Despite being simple, logistic regression is highly interpretable and serves as a strong baseline, especially with appropriate regularization.
Training Process:

Initialize Logistic Regression with regularization (e.g., C=1.0, penalty='l2')
Fit on training set
Generate predictions on validation set
Compute validation metrics
Adjust hyperparameters and iterate

Hyperparameter Variations (Experiments 10-11):

Experiment 10: C=1.0, penalty='l2' (standard L2 regularization)
Experiment 11: C=0.1, penalty='l2' (stronger regularization, simpler model)

Phase 5.3: Experiment Documentation
An experiment table will be systematically maintained throughout Phase 5:
Table Structure:

Experiment ID: Sequential numbering (1-11)
Model Name: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.
Hyperparameters: Exact settings used (e.g., n_estimators=200, max_depth=15)
Dataset Split: Training (700), Validation (150), Test (150)
Training Time: Wall-clock seconds or minutes
Validation Metrics: Accuracy or RMSE on validation set
Test Metrics: Accuracy or RMSE on held-out test set (only computed at the end)
Key Observations: Notes on performance trends, convergence issues, or interesting patterns

Critical Point: Validation metrics will be used during hyperparameter tuning (Experiments 1-11). Only the final, best-performing model configurations will be evaluated on the test set to avoid data leakage and overfitting to the test set.
Phase 5.4: Advanced Techniques for Traditional ML
Feature Selection
Once all models have been trained, feature selection techniques will be applied to understand which features are most predictive:
Approach 1 - Model-Based Feature Importance: Random Forest and XGBoost provide built-in feature importance scores. These indicate how much each feature contributes to prediction accuracy. The top 20-30 features will be identified and their importance visualized.
Approach 2 - Permutation Importance: For SVM and other models without built-in importance, permutation importance will be computed by randomly shuffling each feature and measuring the resulting drop in validation performance. Features that cause larger performance drops are more important.
Application: Once important features are identified, a subset of top-K features (e.g., top 50 features) will be selected, and key models (Random Forest and XGBoost) will be retrained. Performance on this reduced feature set will be compared to the full feature set to assess whether simpler models with fewer features generalize better.
Cross-Validation for Robustness
K-fold cross-validation (K=5) will be applied to the best-performing model to provide a more robust estimate of generalization performance:
Process: The training+validation data (850 samples total) will be split into 5 equal folds. In each fold, 4 folds (680 samples) are used for training, and 1 fold (170 samples) is used for validation. This is repeated 5 times, and average metrics are reported.
Rationale: Cross-validation reduces variance in performance estimates and better utilizes limited data. With 1,000 images, the small dataset can be challenging; cross-validation mitigates this.

PART 6: DEEP LEARNING PIPELINE
Phase 6.1: Deep Learning Architecture Design
Two deep learning architectures will be implemented to contrast with traditional ML:
Architecture 1: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) - Baseline Deep Learning
Conceptual Overview: A fully connected neural network with multiple layers. Input features flow through hidden layers with non-linear activations (ReLU), then to an output layer.
Architecture:

Input layer: 2048 features (from ResNet50) or ~800 features (from manual extraction)
Hidden layer 1: 512 neurons, ReLU activation
Hidden layer 2: 256 neurons, ReLU activation
Hidden layer 3: 128 neurons, ReLU activation
Batch normalization after each hidden layer to stabilize training
Dropout (50%) after each hidden layer to prevent overfitting
Output layer: Softmax (classification) or linear (regression) with appropriate units

Why This Architecture: MLPs are conceptually simple yet powerful. Multiple hidden layers allow the model to learn hierarchical, non-linear representations. Batch normalization and dropout are regularization techniques to prevent overfitting on the small 1,000-image dataset.
Architecture 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Advanced Deep Learning
Conceptual Overview: A neural network designed for image data, using convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial feature hierarchies.
Architecture:

Input: Raw fruit images (224×224×3)
Conv Block 1: 32 filters, 3×3 kernel, ReLU → Max Pooling (2×2)
Conv Block 2: 64 filters, 3×3 kernel, ReLU → Max Pooling (2×2)
Conv Block 3: 128 filters, 3×3 kernel, ReLU → Max Pooling (2×2)
Global Average Pooling: Converts (H, W, C) to (C,)
Dense layer: 256 neurons, ReLU, Dropout (50%)
Dense layer: 128 neurons, ReLU, Dropout (30%)
Output layer: Softmax (classification) or linear (regression)

Why This Architecture: CNNs are the standard for image data. Convolutional layers automatically discover spatially local features (e.g., edges, textures, object parts). Multiple convolutional blocks build increasingly abstract representations. This architecture avoids manually designing features—the network learns them end-to-end.
Phase 6.2: Deep Learning Experiment Strategy
Six deep learning experiments will be conducted, varying architecture design and hyperparameters:
Experiment 12: MLP with Manual Features
Setup: Train the MLP architecture described above using manually extracted features (~800 features from color, texture, shape, defects).
Hyperparameters:

Learning rate: 0.001
Batch size: 32
Epochs: 100 (with early stopping)
Optimizer: Adam
Loss: Categorical Crossentropy (classification) or MSE (regression)

Expected Behavior: The model should learn to map manual features to shelf life predictions. Performance will serve as a baseline for comparing with pre-trained features and end-to-end CNN training.
Experiment 13: MLP with Pre-trained ResNet50 Features
Setup: Train the MLP using pre-trained ResNet50 features (2048-dimensional vectors extracted once from all images).
Hyperparameters: Same as Experiment 12
Rationale: By comparing Experiments 12 and 13, we isolate the effect of feature representation. Pre-trained features from ImageNet should outperform manually designed features because they capture more complex visual patterns learned from 1.4M diverse images.
Expected Insight: This comparison quantifies the value of transfer learning for small datasets.
Experiment 14: MLP with Aggressive Regularization
Setup: Train MLP with manually extracted features but with enhanced regularization to combat overfitting on the small dataset.
Hyperparameters:

Learning rate: 0.0005 (lower, more cautious)
Batch size: 16 (smaller batches for more frequent updates)
Dropout: 70% (more aggressive dropout)
L2 regularization: 0.01 (penalize large weights)
Early stopping: If validation loss doesn't improve for 15 epochs, stop

Expected Behavior: More aggressive regularization should reduce overfitting, increasing the gap between training and validation performance. This trades some training accuracy for better generalization.
Experiment 15: CNN with Raw Images (End-to-End Learning)
Setup: Train the CNN architecture on raw fruit images (224×224×3) without pre-extracting features. The network learns both feature extraction and classification/regression end-to-end.
Hyperparameters:

Learning rate: 0.001
Batch size: 32
Epochs: 100 (with early stopping)
Data augmentation: Random rotations (±15°), brightness variations (±20%), zoom (±10%), horizontal flips applied to training images only
Optimizer: Adam
Loss: Categorical Crossentropy (classification) or MSE (regression)

Rationale: Data augmentation artificially expands the training set by creating variations of existing images. This compensates for the small 1,000-image dataset and improves generalization.
Expected Insight: This experiment demonstrates how much data augmentation helps. It also shows whether a modest CNN can learn useful features directly from images or if transfer learning (pre-trained features) is necessary.
Experiment 16: CNN with Transfer Learning (Fine-tuning)
Setup: Use a pre-trained CNN backbone (ResNet50, trained on ImageNet) but replace the final classification layers with custom layers for shelf life prediction. Only the final few layers are trained; earlier layers (already learned meaningful features from ImageNet) are frozen.
Hyperparameters:

Learning rate: 0.0001 (very low, to preserve pre-trained weights)
Batch size: 32
Epochs: 100 (with early stopping)
Data augmentation: Same as Experiment 15
Optimizer: Adam
Loss: Categorical Crossentropy (classification) or MSE (regression)
Frozen layers: All convolutional layers and initial blocks of ResNet50

Rationale: Transfer learning leverages ImageNet pre-training. We freeze early layers (which learned general visual features like edges and textures) and only train later layers (which adapt to our specific task). This dramatically reduces training time and improves performance with limited data.
Expected Performance: This should achieve the highest accuracy among deep learning models (95-98% for classification, < 2 days RMSE for regression) because it combines the representational power of deep networks with the data efficiency of transfer learning.
Experiment 17: Ensemble Deep Learning
Setup: Train an ensemble combining predictions from Experiments 13 (MLP with pre-trained features), 15 (CNN raw), and 16 (Transfer Learning CNN).
Ensemble Method: Average the prediction probabilities (for classification) or predicted values (for regression) from all three models.
Rationale: Ensembles often outperform individual models because different models capture different aspects of the data. Combining their strengths mitigates individual weaknesses.
Expected Benefit: A modest improvement in robustness and generalization.
Phase 6.3: Training Infrastructure Decisions
Computational Platform: Given the 1,000-image dataset and modest model sizes, training on Google Colab (free GPU T4) will be feasible:

Feature extraction (Experiments 12-13): CPU sufficient (~20-30 minutes)
MLP training (Experiments 12-14): CPU adequate (~5-15 minutes per experiment)
CNN from scratch (Experiment 15): GPU beneficial (~30-60 minutes)
Transfer learning CNN (Experiment 16): GPU beneficial (~20-40 minutes)
Ensemble (Experiment 17): CPU/GPU adequate (~10-15 minutes)

Total Deep Learning Time on Colab: Approximately 2-3 hours of GPU time, well within Colab's free limits.
Phase 6.4: Deep Learning Implementation Technologies
TensorFlow/Keras Sequential API (for Experiments 12-14, MLP models):

Simple, intuitive layer stacking
Suitable for straightforward architectures

TensorFlow/Keras Functional API (for Experiments 15-16, CNN and transfer learning):

More flexible than Sequential
Allows complex architectures, branching, multi-input/output scenarios

tf.data API for data pipeline management:

Efficient data loading and preprocessing
Automatic batching, shuffling, and prefetching
Parallel processing for speed optimization

Data Pipeline Example Flow:

Load images from disk
Apply preprocessing (resize to 224×224, normalize)
Apply augmentation (rotations, brightness, zoom) to training data only
Batch (32 samples per batch)
Prefetch (overlap data loading with model training)
Feed to model

PART 8: MODEL EVALUATION & ERROR ANALYSIS
Phase 8.1: Learning Curve Interpretation
For the best-performing models (XGBoost and Transfer Learning CNN), learning curves will be plotted showing training loss/accuracy and validation loss/accuracy over epochs.
Underfitting Pattern: Training and validation curves both remain high (far from optimal), suggesting the model is too simple to capture the problem.
Overfitting Pattern: Training curve improves significantly, but validation curve plateaus or increases (divergence). This is the typical risk with small datasets.
Good Fit Pattern: Both curves converge to similar, low error values. This indicates the model generalizes well.
Analysis: For each best model, the learning curve will be examined to diagnose whether underfitting or overfitting is occurring and whether the dataset is limiting performance.
Phase 8.2: Confusion Matrix Analysis (Classification)
For the best classification models, confusion matrices will be computed and visualized:
Analysis Questions:

Which ripeness classes are correctly predicted?
Which classes are confused with each other?
Are there systematic patterns (e.g., "ripe" frequently confused with "overripe" because visual boundary is ambiguous)?
Do error patterns differ between traditional ML and deep learning?

Application: If the model frequently confuses "ripe" and "overripe" (both visually similar), this insight guides sellers: the model's uncertainty in this boundary is genuine, not a flaw.
Phase 8.3: ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall Trade-off
For classification tasks, ROC curves (true positive rate vs. false positive rate) will be plotted.
Trade-off Analysis: The model's predictions include confidence scores (probabilities). By varying the decision threshold, we can adjust precision vs. recall:

High threshold (>0.9): Few predictions, high precision, low recall (conservative—only predict class if very confident)
Low threshold (>0.5): Many predictions, lower precision, higher recall (liberal—predict class even if moderately confident)

Application Context: If the cost of false positives (incorrectly flagging a fruit as rotten) is high, we'd set a high threshold. If missing rotten fruits is costly (health risk), we'd lower the threshold.
